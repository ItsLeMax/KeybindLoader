## Special use case

This mod was developed with movie production in mind. Mods like `Blockbuster`, `Aperture` etc. from @McHorse or also
`BetterLights` by Yanis, that changed the scene being huge game changers, have established themselves on Minecraft
version `1.12.2`. Using other versions in the meantime like `1.8.9` for PvP or the latest version `1.21.6+` for anything
else can reset your hotkeys though, which can be quite frustrating with big movie creation mod packs offering several
hotkeys. This mod offers a simple solution to that problem.
